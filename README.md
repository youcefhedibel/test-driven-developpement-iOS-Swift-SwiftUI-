# test-driven-developpement-iOS-Swift-SwiftUI-
This project demonstrates how to implement test-driven development (TDD) in Swift using the XCTest framework. TDD is a software development process in which tests are written before the code to be tested, with the aim of ensuring that the code meets the requirements and is of high quality.

Requirements
## Xcode 12 or later
## Swift 5 or later
Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Xcode.
Build and run the project to ensure that it builds correctly and that all tests pass.
Usage
This project contains a sample implementation of a stack data structure, along with corresponding test cases that demonstrate how to use TDD to develop the implementation. The implementation is contained in the Stack.swift file, and the tests are contained in the StackTests.swift file.

To use this project as a starting point for your own TDD implementation:

Modify the ContentView.swift file to implement your own data structure or functionality.
Modify the TDD_exampleTests.swift and TDD_exampleUITests files to add or modify test cases as needed.
Run the tests using the Test Navigator in Xcode to ensure that your implementation meets the requirements.
